Whatsapp clone website is completely designed using HTML and CSS
Steps To Be Followed:



Create or Locate HTML and CSS Files:
You need to have an existing HTML file and a CSS file. If you don't have these files, you can create them using a text editor or code editor.

Open the HTML File:
Use a text editor or code editor to open your HTML file. You can use software like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Notepad for this purpose.

Copy HTML Content:
Inside the HTML file, copy and paste your HTML content or create a simple HTML structure. For example:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a simple web page.</p>
</body>
</html>
Create or Open the CSS File:
Create a new CSS file (e.g., style.css) or open an existing one if you have it. This is where you'll define your styles.

Copy CSS Styles:
In the CSS file, copy and paste your CSS styles. For example:

css
Copy code
/* style.css */
h1 {
    color: blue;
}

p {
    font-size: 16px;
}
Save the Files:
Make sure to save both the HTML and CSS files after pasting your content.

Connect HTML and CSS:
In the HTML file, you've already included a <link> element that references your CSS file. This line of code connects your HTML and CSS files:

html
Copy code
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
Ensure that the href attribute in the <link> tag matches the name of your CSS file.

View Your Web Page:
You can open your HTML file in a web browser to view the webpage with the connected CSS styles. Simply double-click the HTML file, and your browser should display the styled web page.

That's it! You've successfully copied, pasted, and connected an HTML file to a CSS file to create a styled webpage. Make sure the HTML and CSS files are in the same directory and that the <link> tag in your HTML file correctly points to your CSS file.
